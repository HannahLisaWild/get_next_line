# get_next_line

A project from the 42 curriculum that implements a function to read a file descriptor line by line, returning one line per call, including the newline character if present.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Subject Summary

- Create a function `get_next_line` that reads from a file descriptor and returns the next line.
- Handle reading until a newline `\n` or end-of-file (EOF).
- Manage memory efficiently and handle multiple file descriptors.
- The function returns `NULL` when there is nothing more to read or an error occurs.

ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

    Managing file descriptors and buffered input in C.

    Handling dynamic memory allocation and freeing.

    Implementing efficient line-by-line reading.

    Understanding static variables for persistent state.

    Working with system calls such as read.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Compile

Compile using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
ðŸš€ Usage

Include libftgnl.a in your project and use get_next_line like this:

#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
    {
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
    }
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
